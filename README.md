# FlightSuretyReact
## Udacity Flight Surety Project 7
Student: Michael W. Johnson, Udacity Blockchain 2019

FlightSuretyReact is a sample application project for Udacity's Blockchain course.
This implementation is a React-based DAPP for Udacity Flight Surety Project 7

## Install

This repository contains Smart Contract code in Solidity (using Truffle), tests (also using Truffle), dApp scaffolding (using HTML, CSS and JS) and server app scaffolding.

To install, download or clone the repo, then:
#TBD
`npm install`
`truffle compile`

## Develop Client

To run truffle tests:

`truffle test ./test/flightSurety.js`
`truffle test ./test/oracles.js`

To use the dapp:
# TBD
`truffle migrate`
`npm run dapp`

To view dapp:

`http://localhost:8000`

## Develop Server

`npm run server`
`truffle test ./test/oracles.js`

## Deploy
# TBD
To build dapp for prod:
`npm run dapp:prod`

Deploy the contents of the ./dapp folder

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
